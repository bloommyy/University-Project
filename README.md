# University-Project-2-Semester-Zoo-Game
 This is my university project from 2nd semester. 
 It's a zoo game. You are an owner of a zoo and you can buy or sell cages(elephant or penguin cage).
 You can buy or sell animals(elephant or penguins) in the specified bought cages.
 Animals eat two times a day, if fed - their comfort goes up, if not - it goes down.
 Daily tasks also increase and decrease the animals' comfort.
 Upon comfort getting to Uncomfortable and fodder is empty - the animal will run away.
